inline -> don't use it, it is not good practice
internal -> better then inline
external -> best among all

inline 
    added as 'style' attribute

internal   
    added as style tag in head tag
    
external
    directly mention the changes as done in internal
    here, this file is replaced with the content written in .css file

internal vs external
    that which is written afterwards

inline -> most 


however, it can be changed using "!important" it will be having most priority among all
